            <h1> PUSHING FILES TO GITHUB </h1>
        </header>
        <p>This is a guide on how to push a files to Github. This guide will take use the examole of a markdown text file.  </p>
        <p> The procedure will be broken down into the following steps: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Create first-assignment folder with a text file assignment.md </li>
            <li> Create a Github repository  </li>
            <li> Push folder to Github using Git bash (commandline).  </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2> Create and Save a Text File:  </h2>
        <p> Text files can be created with any text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime text, Visual Studio Code and lots more. The text file in this example is a Markdown text file which is save with the .md file extension (i.e textfile.md). </p> 
        <p> To create your text file open your text editor and save the text file as 'assignment.md' in a folder named first-assignment. </p>
        
        <h2>  Create a Github Repository </h2>
        <p> To create a Github repository, note that you must have <a href="https://github.com/join"> signed up </a>  and have an existing account on github.com and you must also be <a href="https://github.com/login"> logged in </a>. </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Click on the 'New" icon as shown below  
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/new-repository.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the 'New' button to create a new repository">
                        <figcaption> The button opens up a form field to be filled   </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fill the field shown below 
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/repository-name-and-description.png" alt="A new repository form to name the repo ">
                        <figcaption> Fill the form by entering the details of the repository </figcaption>
                        <p>Name your new repository and set a possibly initialize a Readme.md file to be added to your repository</p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/repository-name-and-description.png" alt="repository name and description field ">
                        <figcaption> <strong> Note </strong>that the repository name should not have any space in-between words, use "-" or "_" symbol instead. GitHub will automatically add the "-" symbol if you forget to do so. </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p> There should be a description giving a background story or an insight to the content of the repository.
                        Choose whether it should be a Public repository(i.e visible to others) or Private (i.e visible to you alone). 
                    </p>
                    <p> You can choose to add a Readme.md File which will contain what you have filled in the description above. 
                        Alternatively (which I recommnend) you can chosse not to add a Readme file yet.  
                        <br>
                        (**Note:A ReadMe.md file can be added afterwards** ) 
                        <br>
                        Click "create repository". If you leave the 'initiate Readme.md' unchecked then  you should be seeing a screen that carries the necessary git commands for you to follow.  
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Push folder to Github using Git bash (commandline) </h2>
            <p> To do this successfully you need to have installed GitBash command line on your PC. If you don't have it, click <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"> download</a>  to install it. </p> 
            <p> Open GitBash and navigate to your project folder or right-click inside the GitHub project and select "GitBash here" to open GitBash while working from that directory.  </p>
            <p> Enter the following commands:  </p>
            <pre>
                    > git init   
                    > git add  

            </pre>

            <p> This stages everything in the folder and subfolders  </p>
            <pre>
                > git commit -m "commit message"  
            </pre>
            <p> This applies the changes.  
                <br>
            If this is your first time using GitBash you will need to set your name and email  
            </p>
            <pre>
                > git config --global user.name "John Doe"  
                > git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com  
                > git remote add origin <git repository link ending with .git>  
                > git push -u origin master  
            </pre>
